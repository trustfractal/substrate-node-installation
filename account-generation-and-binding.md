# Account generation
To became a validator you will need to have 2 accounts/addresses:  
[1] Controller account (controller account - setting keys, paying out rewards)  
[2] Stash account (this where your delegeated funds are stored)  
  
To generate new addresses for all chains, the easisest (from Validator node management side) is to use chrome/firefox plugin:
